Primarily, I just want ya’ll to geek out with me about being a Product Owner within an Agile team, working more efficiently, Ruby on Rails, and Entrepreneurship.

I **love** learning; it was my escape during traumatic times in my life, my zen flow is achieved when working through a problem, and it’s what I do when I’m not parenting my 4 kids. The learning is slow (because, kids 🤷🏾‍♀️) but steady and somewhat methodical (because, virgo ♍️). 

Aht, aht -– you heard “virgo” and here we go.....
😂
