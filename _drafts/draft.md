# Give me Decent Copy
My shiny new life coaching business‚Äô website was coming along nicely: my services‚Äô prices and descriptions were prominent & explicit, and I finally got the hero message to convey what I wanted. 
Each time I tried to write copy for the rest of my site (read: why you should choose me to help you plan & execute your next successful goal) I couldn‚Äôt. I found myself writing about my services‚Äô features as opposed to helping my future customers envision their new normal and where I fit in along that journey. Here‚Äôs what I mean:

‚Å†Insert example of a feature (eg: you get a plan, 3 hours talk time, etc.)

Insert example of better copy‚Å†

As a Tech Product Owner, I knew convincing a customer to buy your product primarily because of its features rarely works; I figured selling a service is no different. 

## Inauthentic at Best; A Pompous Asshole at Worst
This is life coaching; when a customer purchases a service, they‚Äôre purchasing me. Not in the ‚ÄúPretty Woman‚Äù kind of way, you nutjob ü•¥. 

When we engage in one or more sessions, you're getting my personality, years of experience in problem definition and scoping, and other goodies that are uniquely me. So when I talk about helping my future customers envision their new normal, it meant I had to ultimately talk about me üò±

The qualities I thought about were the ones I wanted to be known for in this space, admitedly. When I read those qualities out loud I felt uncomfortable. It felt like I was trying to convince someone of who I was as opposed to describing who I am - there's a subtle difference. Think: sleazy car salesman vs. an enthusiastic car owner...
...the former is jumping through hoops and crafting an idea of the car being sold; the latter happily tells of times the car performed expertly while looking good doing it.  I'm buying a car cause that owner seemed so pleased with theirs. üëçüèæ 

## Let Others Talk About You
If I'm creating a whole-ass business to help people define, scope, and solve problems, best believe this ain't my first time. I've done this before! üí™üèæ It may have been in a different context (Product Owner) and those I've helped were friends and colleagues instead of customers - but their opinion was golden. I knew that what they thought of me was what I present to the world - authentically and naturally so. Here's how I got their thoughts about me and (at the same time) did a little research about: how people approached problems and what they thought of life coaches in general. 

# Steps to Create Authentic Copy
## Conduct Interviews

Selecting the right folks to interview
Who I wanted to interview was the most important decision‚Å† in this whole process. I needed feedback from people who solved or worked through:
challenging problems with me and
did so over time
Problem complexity and length of time were factors that I knew needed to exist for someone to form a strong, well-rounded opinion of me. 

Selecting the right number of people to interview
Next, I guessed 5-10 people was the "right" number.  Gathering info from the recordings of the interviews I conduct is always time consuming so I knew I didn't want (or need) a lot of participants. 

Plus, I just needed enough people to help ensure I got different responses. 

Lastly, creating copy (like most things) is an iterative process; I don't need to be perfect here. I'm just getting a quick pulse for now. As I aquire feedback from actual customers over time, the copy will change because I'll learn why paying customers value my services. 

In the end, 7 wonderful souls responded to this text message, typos and all. ‚ô•Ô∏è The actual number interviewed was 5 ü•≥



Creating questions for your script
In my career, I've learned to heed the words of our modern-day prohpehts - Bell Biv Devoe - and never trust:
the answer that comes after "why do you want this product / feature" 
the answer to "would you use this product/feature"
This is DEFINITELY encoded in their song, "Poison's" lyrics... listen to the record backwards. üôÉ

It's a real fact that y'all humans be lying. What you would do and the motivations behind your wants are the stuff of 1960 Disney animations üòí - fantasy. I crafted questions that spoke to what folks actually did or experienced. There are some fallacies with memory too, buuuut I banked on the fact that strong reactions (positive or negative) would make a lasting mark. 
Here are some examples:
‚Å†Insert examples here‚Å†

Collecting the responses
As mentioned, I recorded each interview so I could be completely engaged in the conversation.  I used a script to keep me on track but held space for the occassional rabbit hole to engulfed us when a point needed more clarity. 

I used a digital whiteboard (as opposed to a spreadsheet or other tabular-like software) to keep my responses. You'll see why in a few. üëÄ
For my tactile folks, a wall and sticky notes works just as well. 
I fashioned my digital whiteboard to look like this:
